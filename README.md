# Sassruist
Sassruist is the evil Scss ampersand slayer.

## Unimplemented
### Only Scss
I made a mistake and gave up.

### A parent and a child sandwich @commands
In these cases, ampersands are not resolved.
```scss
.parent {      
  @include sp {
     &__a {}   
  }            
}              
```

## Usage
